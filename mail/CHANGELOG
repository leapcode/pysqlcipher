    class. Closes: #6361.

  o MessageCollection iterator now creates the LeapMessage with the
    collection reference, so setFlags will work properly.
  o account#addMailbox can't allow empty mailbox names since it makes

    Folder. Closes #4209.

  o Allow to iterate in an empty mailbox during fetch. Closes #4603
  o Add 'signencrypt' preference to OpenPGP header on outgoing

    MUAs. Closes: #4461
  o Check username in authentications. Closes: #4299
